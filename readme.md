# Mega Menu - WordPress Template

## :open_book: Overview

This is just a simple template for a mega menu in WordPress. This template can only be used in WordPress sites that support Full Site Editing.

## :rocket: Features

The template features a combination of grid and flex containers to create a simple but effective mega menu. This template requires the [Caledros Basic Blocks plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/caledros-basic-blocks/) to work properly.

## :package: How to use it

1. Install and activate the [Caledros Basic Blocks plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/caledros-basic-blocks/)
2. Create and edit a Mega Menu Template part.
3. Copy and paste the contents of the "mega-menu-template.html" file using the code editor view. Then change to the visual editor.
4. Replace the placeholder images for your own images or icons. It's preferable to use square images 40px wide and high.
5. Save the changes.
